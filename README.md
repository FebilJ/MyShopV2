# 🛒 My Shop V2 - Automated Testing Framework

## Overview
[My Shop V2](http://www.automationpractice.pl/index.php) is a demo e-commerce website used for practicing web automation testing. The platform provides various features such as user authentication, product search, cart management, and checkout, making it an ideal candidate for automation testing.

## Automated Testing Implementation
I developed an automation testing framework using **Selenium WebDriver, Java, Maven, TestNG, and Page Object Model (POM)** to ensure the accuracy and functionality of key web application features.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- **Functional Testing:** Automates user login, product search, cart operations, and checkout process.
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Uses external test data to validate different scenarios.
- **Logging & Reporting:** Integrated **Log4j2** for debugging and **Extent Reports** for result visualization.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated test execution using **Jenkins** for continuous validation.
- **Version Control:** Managed framework using **Git & GitHub**.

This automation ensures the reliability and stability of the e-commerce website by identifying defects early in the development lifecycle. 🐞✅
